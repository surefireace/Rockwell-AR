1. download server SDK found here: https://www.photonengine.com/en-us/sdks#server-sdkserverserver
ps no need for the plugin sdk for server

2. run the sdk application and choose the location for it to extract.

3. follow instructions here:https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/server/current/getting-started/photon-server-in-5min
to get the server running make sure to set the Game Server IP config to public/automatic
ps dont use MMO demo

4. go into unity under Window > Photon Unity Networking > Highlite server settings. uncheck "Use Name Server" and 
enter the IP adress of the server the same one that the Game Server IP config is set too. port 4530 and protocol Tcp.

5. app id realtime doesnt matter but make sure it isnt blank same for app id chat and app version. 
fixed region can and should be left empty. everything else should not be messed with.

6. make sure that the server is running and start the application and connect. if there are issues try 
running the TestClient that comes with the server. open in a text editor:
Photon-OnPremise-Server-SDK_v4-0-29-11263 > deploy > bin_tools > stardust.client > Photon.StarDust.Client.exe.config
change the protocol to Tcp, change the ServerAddress to the same that the server is using IP:port, and
change StartupInterval to 1000
